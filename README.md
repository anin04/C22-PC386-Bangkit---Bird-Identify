### About
Indonesia is a country with various kinds of animals, one of which is birds. As we know, there are many types of birds in Indonesia. Indonesia is listed as one of the countries with the highest number of bird species in the world, with a total of 1,720 species, as wikipedia said. So we often find it difficult to distinguish the types of birds in Indonesia. Bird identify is an application that can help us to recognize the types of birds in Indonesia, so  this application can certainly make it easier for us to find out the name of the bird.

2.	Mobile Development : Create ui design in figma and deploy to android studio 
* In the second stage :
1.	Machine Learning : Create the training and validation batch using the train generator then create the labeling
2.	Mobile Development :  Carry out system development such as login, registration system, forgot password system, logout settings, about us profile, and the last is identify system
* In the third stage :
1.	Machine Learning : Create the model then training and validation and    convert the model into tflite model.
2.	Mobile Development : Deploy tensorflow lite models to android studio do testing
* In the final stage :
1.	Mobile Development : Do testing and build the project into apk
